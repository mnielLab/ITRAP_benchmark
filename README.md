# Data-driven filtering for denoising of TCRpMHC single-cell data: a benchmark

## Data

This repo contains the 10x Genomic datasets filtered using iIRAP and ICON denoising frameworks.

- raw.csv contains positive examples of binding peptide-TCR pairs from the original 10x Genomic dataset;

- ITRAP.csv and icon.csv are the result of filtering the original raw.csv using ITRAP and ICON, respectively;

- raw_train.csv, ITRAP_train.csv and icon_train.csv are the datasets used to train the relative models. Here, the positive data points are derived from the above-described datasets. The negative data is generated by paring the positive TCRs to a peptide different from its target cognate (denoted as swapped negatives). The negative set is augmented by adding negative control TCRs from https://github.com/viragbioinfo/IMMREP_2022_TCRSpecificity. The data is randomly split into 5 partitions fot 5-fold cross-validation. Here, the list of epitopes is restricted to 4 (GILGFVFTL,	GLCTLVAML, ELAGIGILTV, IVTDFSVIK); 

- vdj_eval.csv contains an evaluation set derived from VDJdb. Also here, the positive TCRs reger to 4 epitopes (GILGFVFTL, 	GLCTLVAML, ELAGIGILTV, IVTDFSVIK) and the negative data is generated by swapping positive TCR-peptide pairs and augmented by adding negative controls.
